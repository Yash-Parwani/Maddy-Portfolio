{
    "name":Gayatri Malladi,
    "brief_intro_about_her":"Gayatri Malladi is currently working towards her Master of Science in Data Science at the University of Washington and is expected to graduate in June 2026.
She has a strong foundation in Computer Science with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science with Software Engineering from Sri Ramaswamy Memorial Institute of Science and Technology, which she completed between September 2020 and June 2024.

       "why_is_this_required":"SYSTEM_PROMPT",
       "experiences" : "1)Zero-Day Attack Detection: While working as a Research Intern at the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) from September 2023 to March 2024, Gayatri developed a Graph CodeBert and DCGAN model to detect Zero-Day attacks and insecure design flaws like Insufficient Compartmentalization and Critical State Information. This model used image processing to visually represent data flow analysis.
 
2) Suicide Prevention: During her time as a Researcher at the National University of Singapore from January 2023 to June 2023, Gayatri conducted a research study focusing on Suicide Attempt (SA) and Suicide Ideation (SI) prevention. She used the Bidirectional Encoder Representations Transformer Model (BERT) for text classification prediction and achieved an accuracy of 87.7%. The study also involved implementing vectorizers like GloVe, Word2Vec, FastText, and CBOW.
 
3) Construction Worker Safety: From December 2022 to January 2023, Gayatri worked as a Research Intern at both the National University of Singapore and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During that time, she optimized a real-time AI-based smart construction worker safety inspection model to address fatal construction accidents stemming from manual supervision methods and a shortage of qualified site inspectors. She developed an object detection model using various algorithms including CNN, RCNN, SSD, and Faster-RCNN and compared their performance. This model was then integrated into a website. As part of this research, Gayatri also gained experience in data analysis, specifically data engineering, using Microsoft Azure to predict survival rates based on a Titanic dataset.
 
4) Stroke Rehabilitation: Gayatri is currently involved in collaborative research, for her "Special Topics in Computing: Data Mining for Machine Learning" course, that focuses on utilizing pre and post-stroke EEG and EMG data to assist patients with upper limb extremity motor disabilities. Her work in this project involves performing Independent Component Analysis, Frequency Filtering, Statistical Analysis, generating Normal Distribution plots, and creating Correlation Scatter Plots to study the variations in motor abilities across different brain channels before and after a stroke.
 
5) Vulnerability Detection: For her "Machine Learning" course, Gayatri is conducting research on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect vulnerable code. She uses Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques on open-source LLMs and aims to explain the results using the self-explainability capabilities of LLMs. The research involves developing a pipeline by indexing code snippets from the VulBench dataset (excluding the test set) and parsing documents to include labels within the code itself.
 
6) Multimodal Emotion Recognition: Gayatri's thesis, undertaken between December 2023 and May 2024, focuses on deepfake detection in videos and images. She uses Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) models to detect inconsistencies in emotional expressions. For FER, she implemented a CNN-LSTM model. For SER, she used an MLP classifier, CNN-LSTM, and RNN, successfully classifying 33 emotions."

1) Hands-on experience with static and dynamic tools for web application security testing acquired during her internship at C-DAC.
